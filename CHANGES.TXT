v2.0.3
----------
Released: 2017-02-13
- Applied minor bugfixes and updated documentation for v2.0.x
- The UVVM release of OSVVM has been removed from the repository due to the fact that it was a outdated

v2.0.2
----------
Released: 2017-02-01
- Applied minor bugfixes after beta testing. This affects all components in the UVVM package.


v2.0.1
----------
Released: 2017-01-27

This release is not backwards compatible and may require some changes in your tesbench and custom VVCs.

- Change required in your test bench / test harness :
     Replace for example
        i_initialize_uvvm : initialize_uvvm;
     with
        i_ti_uvvm_engine  : entity uvvm_vvc_framework.ti_uvvm_engine;

- Changes required in your custom VVCs (if any) are listed in the CHANGES.TXT file in the sub directory uvvm_vvc_framework.
- Changes required in your BFM calls : see CHANGES.TXT in the respective BFM folder.
  Some parameters have been reordered in order to minimize the difference between BFM and VVC calls.

All VIPs have been altered for this release.

- For VVC designers there are some changes as well. In order to function with the new UVVM it is recommended to apply these changes:
1. For *_vvc.vhd
  - add "variable local_vvc_cmd : t_vvc_cmd_record := C_VVC_CMD_DEFAULT;" to variable list in cmd_interpreter process
  - add parameter local_vvc_cmd to work.td_vvc_entity_support_pkg.await_cmd_from_sequencer(C_VVC_LABELS, vvc_config, THIS_VVCT, VVC_BROADCAST, global_vvc_ack, shared_vvc_cmd, local_vvc_cmd)
  - exchange shared_vvc_cmd with local_vvc_cmd in the cmd_interpreter except for the line above as it is copied in that function
  - add parameter local_vvc_cmd to uvvm_vvc_framework.ti_vvc_framework_support_pkg.acknowledge_cmd(global_vvc_ack,local_vvc_cmd.cmd_idx)
You can take a look at all our VVCs.

2. For vvc_methods_pkg.vhd
  - delete shared_vvc_cmd := C_VVC_CMD_DEFAULT; line in each procedure before set_general_target_and_command_fields
  - make sure that the ordering of commands in each function is:
    1. set_general_target_and_command_fields. It must be executed before any access to shared_vvc_cmd
    2. after the command send_command_to_vvc(VVCT); there must also be no access to shared_vvc_cmd
